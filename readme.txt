This is the mod template, here is some rules:

ONLY YOUR FIRST/DEFAULT SCRIPT FILE SHOULD HAVE USINGS.
when i say first/default i mean the first in Script Execution Order.
Theoretically you can do this, but i dont recommend since these usings will be global, and most surely you will
end up duplicating them lol

There is absolutely more limitations related to Rosyln compiler, but i cant list all of them here, so read their docs if
you are having trouble.

You can use Harmony Patching, but in older devices, the chance for it to fully work is low.

Your mod image resolution should be 000x000 (replace number later), if it isn't, it will probably be bigger
than the mod box itself
